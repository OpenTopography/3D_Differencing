A windowed implementation of the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is used to calculate displacement and rotation fields from topographic point clouds 
that span a geologic event of interest. This technique resolves surface deformation along and adjacent to active faults where other geodetic datasets commonly 
lack spatial resolution. 

We provide two sets of codes to perform 3D ICP differencing. 

https://github.com/OpenTopography/3D_Differencing/tree/master/3D_differencing_matlab
This option uses Matlab scripts. The Matlab script is relatively easy to set-up, although it will take a while to complete. 


https://github.com/OpenTopography/3D-Differencing/tree/master/3D_differencing_python
This option uses Python and c++ functions to perform ICP differencing. The set-up is more involved than for the Matlab option, but the scripts will run much faster.  


Pre- and post- earthquake topographic datasets for the M7 Kumamoto, Japan, earthquake are available here.
